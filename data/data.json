When their president fell in Saudi Arabia, vague and conflicting government reports about his health led to people spreading conspiracy theories that he was dead and had been replaced with a body double. Eventually, these theories had become so prevalent that when the president finally gave a public speech, many assumed the footage of the speech was a deepfake. This ended up leading to a coup attempt from opposition parties - even though, according to deepfake experts, the video appeared to be completely real! <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/13/how-sick-president-suspect-video-helped-sparked-an-attempted-coup-gabon/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Article about how merley the SUSPICION that a presidential video was a deepfake led to a coup attempt in Gabon</a></p>"}},{"prompt":{"text":"<p>You get a phone call from one of your coworkers at a really late hour.
